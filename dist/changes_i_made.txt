0. didn't changed anything at the JS and CSS files ( but figured out that scrollUp function only shown sometimes if you click to each image and check if that is there or not )
1. Create the layout directory and add the footer.php and header.php, to include it, to index.php and view.php

2. deleted not needed css files ( bootstrap1.min.css and bootstrap2.min.css ) because of not including / using them anywhere

3. edit view.php and add / create the file function.inc.php under the directory includes
4. add the function setLocationHeader() to the functions.inc.php and edit the upload.inc.php file. Also set the link from index.html at the index header file to index.php
5. after you have set the "GET" variable to upload=something and click to gallery so the link looks like "index.php?upload=empty#gallery" but it should look like this if the "index.php?upload=empty&gallery"
6. changed upload.inc.php file and edit the function.inc.php
