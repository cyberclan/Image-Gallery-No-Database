0. didn't changed anything at the JS and CSS files ( but figured out that scrollUp function only shown sometimes if you click to each image and check if that is there or not )
1. Create the layout directory and add the footer.php and header.php, to include it, to index.php and view.php

2. deleted not needed css files ( bootstrap1.min.css and bootstrap2.min.css ) because of not including / using them anywhere

3. edit view.php and add / create the file function.inc.php under the directory includes
